# MAGD 150
Here, I have uploaded three projects from this semester. Each section details what is occurring in each project.

## Assignment 6
#### File: [wilke-6.zip](https://github.com/WilkeJO15/Master/files/11298253/wilke-6.zip)
For this assignment, I had to achieve the following goals:
* Create an array, assign values to the array, and print these values
* Create motion with these values and draw shapes
* Utilize for loops and the mouse position to determine motion and values

What I created for this assignment is a black background with white squares falling from the top of the canvas to the bottom at random placements based on the array. _These squares will eventually stop._  
While these squares are falling, a red square follows your mouse as it is moved across the canvas. 
While the square moves, it fades in color from red to yellow, and eventually disappears. The faster you move the mouse, the more space there is between each square.

## Assignment 7
#### File: [wilke-4.zip](https://github.com/WilkeJO15/Master/files/11298254/wilke-4.zip)
For this assignment, I had to achieve the following goals:
* Draw a shape made from other shapes as its own function
* Utilize various methods, such as scale, rotate, and angle
* Utilize the push, pop, and print functions

What I created for this assignment is a background with shapes that resemble brick blocks from Mario. I'll refer to it as **brick** for the purposes of this explanation.  
Brick is composed of several squares in order to achieve the look of a brick block, and brick is its own function as well.  
Brick is repreated several times throughout the sketch, with different random rotations and scales for each individual brick.
In addition to the brick function, the push and pop functions are used to create the brick shape. 

## Assignment 8
#### File: [wilke-5.zip](https://github.com/WilkeJO15/Master/files/11298255/wilke-5.zip)
For this assignment, I had to achieve the following goals:
* Load images to be used in the file and assign variables to the images.
* Use the mouse position to change the size and location of the image
* Create text using the text and textFont functions

What I created for this assignment is a canvas with text, two photos, and a little bit of a gimmick.
Upon opening the file, you'll see text asking "What could this be?"
#### Picture 1
Picture 1 is a .png file of person shrugging and standing next to a question mark. This image changes in scale based on the mouse position.
#### Picture 2
Picture 2 is a .gif file of Rick Astley from his "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video. You guessed it... I rickrolled you. This image changes in position based on the mouse position.
My intention with this file was for the question mark image to cover up most of the canvas, and as the user moves their mouse, the rickroll is revealed. Though it is not perfect, it gets the job done.
